Cloud based perftests
=====================

When running perftest in a cloud env (AWS, GCP), we (currently) define the following attributes as constants:
* Number of nodes: 8
* Threads: 100
* Message size: 1000 bytes
* Read/write ratio: 80/20
* Number of keys 100'000
* Warump time: 60s
* Time: 120s
* Machine type: GCP c2-standard-8 (eval again!) / AWS ?

JDK command line (already in run.sh):
* -Xmx2G -Xms2G

Permutations:
* vthreads: enable / disable
* JDK: 17, 21, 25-ea-latest
* configs: standard JGroups (UNICAST3), new JGroups (UNICAST4)
* Versions: Infinispan 15.0.11 / JGroups 5.3.14, Infinispan 15.1.x / JGroups 5.4.x

With JGroups < 5.4, the new configs are not available, so we have 2 * 3 = 6 permutations.
With JGroups 5.4.x, we have 2 * 3 * 3 = 12 permutations.

We first run the 5.3.14 combo of 6 permutations (= 6 runs) via Ansible, then change the versions in pom.xml,
mvn clean package, then run the 12 permutations via Ansible.

When done, results.txt is fetched from the leader and displayed graphically. To that end, we need to think how
to display the results, so they can be fed to a Google docs spreadsheet, or another graphing tool.
